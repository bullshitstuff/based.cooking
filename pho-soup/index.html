Life will be easier if you can place the spices in a tea strainer of sorts, otherwise, it&rsquo;s not the worst thing in the world fishing them out later on.</li><li>Add beef bouillon cubes, diced beef, fish/oyster sauce, and honey/sugar, then simmer for a couple hours with the lid on.</li><li>Cook the rice noodles (should only take a few minutes, just until the texture is al dente enough).</li><li>Once the broth is done cooking, fish out the spices that you added at step 2. It&rsquo;s worth doing this rather than accidentally chewing on a bit of star anise, trust me.</li><li>Cut up coriander and spring onions as garnish.</li><li>Add rice noodles to bowl, followed by the broth and its contents, followed by the garnish. This can be made and eaten within 1 hour if you want it quickly, but typically with broths the longer you simmer the tastier it&rsquo;ll be.</li></ol><h2>Contributor(s)</h2><ul><li><a href=https://jonburga.com>Jon Burga</a><ul><li><img src=/pix/btc.svg alt="BTC Logo">Bitcoin: <code>bc1qqsj592ls8xdhxpf5h4e8wj2w3v9uvv6mc6gz7f</code></li></ul></li></ul><div id=nextprev><a href=/sourdough-potato-bread/><div id=prevart>Previous:<br>Potato sourdough bread</div></a><a href=/pepper-sauce/><div id=nextart>Next:<br>Pepper Sauce</div></a></div><div style=clear:both class=taglist><a id=tag_vietnamese href=https://based.cooking/tags/vietnamese>Vietnamese</a> &#183; <a id=tag_beef href=https://based.cooking/tags/beef>Beef</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://based.cooking/>https://based.cooking/</a><br><br><a href=/index.xml><img src=/rss.svg style=max-height:1.5em alt="RSS Feed" title="Subscribe via RSS for updates."></a></footer></body></html>
