&lt;h2 id="story">Story&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A poor friar who was on a pilgrimage stopped in the village of Almeirim and knocked on the door of a house. He was too proud to beg for a bite to eat, so instead, he requested a large pot in which he could make “a delicious and filling…….stone soup”. With arched eyebrows and curious glances, the family invited him into their home and set up a large pot over flickering flames and filled with water. Slowly walking up to the ironclad cauldron, the friar reached into his deep pocket to produce a smooth and well-cleaned stone that he promptly dropped into the boiling water. A little while later he tasted the soup and said that it needed a touch of seasoning. So the wife brought him some salt to add, to which he suggested that maybe a little bit of chouriço (sausage), or pork belly, would be better. Graciously, she obliged and dropped several thick slices into the pot. Then, the friar asked if she might not have a little something to enrich the soup, such as potatoes or beans from a previous meal. With a broad smile, she agreed, and added a healthy portion into the bubbling water. This banter continued back and forth between the family and the friar before he finally announced that he had indeed made a very delicious and filling soup. When the soup was done, the friar fished the stone out of the pot, washed and dried it off, and plopped it back in his pocket for the next time.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>According to the people of Almeirim&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Good in combination with red wine, beer sauce that I am going to also provide the ingredients and directions on how to do, &lt;a href="https://based.cooking/rice">rice&lt;/a>, french fries and a salad.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>sirloin steaks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>garlic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>olive oil q.b. (quanto basta – ‘enough’)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>medium fat milk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>beer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mustard&lt;/li>
&lt;li>flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Season the steaks with sliced garlic and salt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a frying pan, bring the steaks to the boil in abundant olive oil (to make the sauce later) and let it fry. Season with salt only when you are frying them. Remove and set aside in a dish covered with aluminum foil to keep them warm.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a low heat add to the sauce of the steaks, a little more butter or margarine and let it melt. Then add the milk and let it boil a little.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then add the beer, the mustard and the flour dissolved in a little water or milk and stir it well. Add to this sauce the sauce that was formed in the dish of the steaks. Add a little pepper, and stir until it always thickens over a low heat. Rectify the seasonings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the sauce is ready, place the reserved steaks again in the skillet for a few more minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fry the eggs (use a non-stick frying pan that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any fat) and season the egg white with salt and the yolk with black pepper.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place the steaks with the sauce and the egg on top in clay bowls and serve with french fries, white rice and salad.&lt;/li>
