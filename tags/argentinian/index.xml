Substitute for Nootella or similar &amp;ldquo;food&amp;rdquo;. It is very demanding, so i only recommend you make it if you either can&amp;rsquo;t buy industrial dulce de leche (It will be way more natural than other sweets anyway), or have the time and interest to go through the process. It can be made more easily with sweetened condensed milk, but if you have access to it, you can get DDL anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>⏲️ Prep time: 5 min&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🍳 Cook time: 3 hours&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🍽️ Servings: An average-sized mason jar.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 liter of milk.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>350 grams of sugar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Half a teaspoon of baking soda.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A vanilla bean, or essence (Optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two glass marbles (Optional, but it is a traditional way to prevent sticking, and they will not break in the process.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Heat all ingredients in a pan (with the marbles, if you want,) on a medium-heat stove, constantly mixing with a wooden spoon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the sugar dissolves, set heat to very low, and keep mixing once in a while for approximately two hours. It should not boil, if it happens, set it aside, keep mixing and once the temperature lowers put it back on the heat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the preparation gets thicker, be more careful and mix it more frequently so that it does not stick (and burn)
and lumps do not form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once you get a consistency similar to that of a custard, set it aside and keep mixind for 10 minutes, until it gets
cold and thickens a bit more. If you put a spoon inside, pass your finger in the middle and it does not unite anymore, it is done.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once cold, put it on a glass jar and leave it in the fridge, or sterilize it.&lt;/li>

Never have it by yourself, instead with friends or family, and a cup/gourd of Mate.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>⏲️ Prep time: 1h 10min or 2h 10min, (depending on how long you leave it to rest.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🍳Cook time: 10 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🍽️ Servings : 10.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1.1 pound (1/2 kilo) of all-purpose flour.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 tablespoons of lard or butter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 cup of water mixed with a teaspoon of salt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Oil or grease of choice for frying. (Modern Argentines use refined tallow or sunflower seed oil, but for the real gaucho way, unrefined lard or tallow is the right choice)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sugar, cinnamon, or herbs and spices of choice (Optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Add the flour on a bowl, and the grease in ambient temperature in the middle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mix flour and grease with your fingertips, while slowly adding the salt water, until you end up with a dough ball.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knead it energically, until the dough forms bubbles on its surface.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let it rest for 1 or 2 hours, and then form little balls, the size you&amp;rsquo;d do for a chocolate chip cookie, smash them to a disc shape, then poke a small hole in the middle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fry it on abundant grease until golden brown, remove it with a perforated spoon, then put it on a bowl with paper towels to absorb excess grease.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add garnishes, but it is not essential, due to how rich and filling the dish is.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item></channel></rss>
