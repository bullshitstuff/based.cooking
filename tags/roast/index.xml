&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll need a good-sized lidded pot that can go in the oven for this. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t have that then you can use a large roasting tray with sides and cover it with foil, sealing it as best you can. It&amp;rsquo;s an excellent celebration or Sunday meal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lamb shoulder, or something similar, like lamb shank, preferably on the bone. Get something that will fit in your pot, with room for vegetables around it. For example, I usually get half a shoulder, 2 – 3 lbs, 1 – 1.5kg.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a whole head of garlic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 carrots&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 leek&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 onion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 lemons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>oregano&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rosemary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>potatoes (optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>yoghurt (optional, to serve)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fresh bread (optional, to serve)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;em>On the night before:&lt;/em> Mix up some olive oil, the juice of half a lemon, the oregano, the rosemary, and some salt and pepper. Rub this mixture into the meat and leave it in the fridge overnight to marinate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>The next day:&lt;/em> Heat the oven to 375°F/190°C/gas mark 5.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break apart the garlic. You can leave the skin on the cloves, or you can peel them, as you prefer. Chop the carrots, leek, onion, the remaining lemon, and the potatoes into chunks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arrange the meat in the pot with the vegetables underneath and around it. Pour in any marinating juices, as well as a cup of water.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cook for 2½ – 3 hours. Half way through it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to check and see if it needs some more water to keep things from burning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove the lid and let the meat brown for a few minutes if you think it needs it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pull the meat apart and serve, with yoghurt and fresh bread. You can use the juices as a gravy.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Medieval beef soup with turnips and turnip greens.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>One beef roast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Around three to four large turnips with their greens attached&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two cups of chicken stock&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/10 grams of Saffron&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 a stick of butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A slow cooker&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A bowl of warm water.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Cube the roast into bite sized pieces and place them in a large skillet with the butter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heat the pan on medium-high heat and brown the meat with the melted butter until the outside is evenly cooked, sprinkle with pepper as it browns.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While the meat is browning, cut the greens off the turnips and set them aside. Cut the turnips into bite sized pieces making sure to cut the top and bottom ends off first. If you can not find turnips with their greens still attached Mustard greens can be substituted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put the cut up turnips in the slow cooker and pour in the chicken stock.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take the meat and dump it into the slow cooker drippings and all. If the amount of liquid looks a bit low to you, you can pour in another cup or so of water at your discretion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sprinkle more pepper over the soup and put the saffron in the bowl of warm water and let it seep for five minutes. Then dump it and the warm water into the soup.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cut the stems off of the greens and then chop the greens vertically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cook the soup on high for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the turnip and meat are soft and tender. About 20 minutes before it is to be done take the chopped greens and put them in the soup. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it overfills the slow cooker, the greens will shrink a ton. Cook for about 20 minutes until done.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taste the soup, if it&amp;rsquo;s still too bland you can add spices of your choice and season to your taste.&lt;/li>

The thermometer ensures the chicken comes out juicy and delicious.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Boneless skinless chicken breast(s)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 stick of butter per chicken breast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seasoning (optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Fill a large bowl with enough water to submerge the chicken. Add salt to the water until it&amp;rsquo;s fully saturated. Put the chicken under the water and let it sit for 20-40 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Preheat the oven to 230°C / 450°F.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove the chicken from the water. Rinse it. Dry it. Put it in a roasting pan (you can use a casserole dish, oven-safe skillet, or baking pan too).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brush the chicken with melted butter. For best results, brush all sides of the chicken breast.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Season with pepper and any optional seasoning. Season with salt last.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Insert the thermometer probe into the thickest part of the smallest breast.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bake until the internal temperature reaches 68°C / 155°F.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove from the oven and immediately cover with foil leaving the probe inserted. Let the chicken sit for 10 minutes at room temperature. The chicken will continue to cook. It should reach at least 74°C / 165°F but if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, see &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/49opyx/cooking_chicken_to_temps_below_165_is_it_safe/">this reddit post&lt;/a> about food safety when cooking chicken to less than 165°F.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Serve&lt;/li>

&lt;p>An herbaceous pancetta stuffed pork roast with a crispy exterior. Finished with a lemon vinaigrette.
Adapted from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgFaljoriYA">Binging With Babish&lt;/a> whose instructions are notoriously bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>⏲️ Prep time: 30 minutes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🍳 Cook time: 2 hours&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🍽️ Servings: 6-8 people&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="equipment">Equipment&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Food processor&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fine mesh strainer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cast iron skillet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Butchers twine&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 pork Roast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2-3 Tbsp fresh rosemary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>8 cloves garlic, minced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>⅓ cup high quality olive oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 lemon&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 oz pancetta or bacon&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tsp fresh parsley&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Preheat oven to 275°F (135°C)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Butterfly the roast by cutting into three parts by cutting into the side starting a third of the way up the roast. When you get to the end of the roast open it up and repeat for the remaining roast. You&amp;rsquo;re opening it up like a pamphlet. Refer to the video linked above if you&amp;rsquo;re confused.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cover with plastic wrap and beat with meat mallet to pound the pork to an even levelness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mince garlic cloves(8) with the rosemary(2 Tbsp). Place into a cold pan with olive oil(⅓ cup) and zest of lemon(1). Keep lemon for later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bring to slow simmer on medium low heat for 2-3 minutes. Strain the herbs making sure to squeeze all excess oil. Reserve oil for later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add pancetta/bacon(4 oz) to food processor. Pulse a few times before adding the garlic/rosemary mixture. Process until a smooth paste forms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Salt and pepper both sides of the roast before placing the roast fat side down and spreading the paste over the roast leaving about a 2 inch gap on one side.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Roll tightly towards the 2 inch gap and use butchers twine to secure the roll. Place a knot every inch or so.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bake at 275°F (135°C) for 2 hours or until internal temperature reads 135°F (57°C) in the thickest part.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add olive oil to cast iron skillet and heat on high until ripping hot. Cut remaining lemon in half. Brown all sides of pork roast and lemon using tongs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Juice the lemon into the remaining oil from the garlic/rosemary herb spread. Add freshly chopped parsley. Whisk with fork until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Slice roast into ½ inch thick slices and top with lemon herb vinaigrette.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h5 id="a-note-on-ingredient-snootiness">A note on ingredient snootiness&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>I point out that ingredients need to be fresh, the olive oil high quality, the salt needs to be kosher, and the pepper freshly ground not because I&amp;rsquo;m some rich snob but because it actually matters. The olive oil is one of the main flavors in this dish and it will taste significantly worse if you cheap out. Herbs, especially rosemary, don&amp;rsquo;t even taste the same when comparing dried to fresh.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
