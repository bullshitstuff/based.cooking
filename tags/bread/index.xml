Never have it by yourself, instead with friends or family, and a cup/gourd of Mate.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>⏲️ Prep time: 1h 10min or 2h 10min, (depending on how long you leave it to rest.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🍳Cook time: 10 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🍽️ Servings : 10.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1.1 pound (1/2 kilo) of all-purpose flour.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 tablespoons of lard or butter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 cup of water mixed with a teaspoon of salt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Oil or grease of choice for frying. (Modern Argentines use refined tallow or sunflower seed oil, but for the real gaucho way, unrefined lard or tallow is the right choice)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sugar, cinnamon, or herbs and spices of choice (Optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Add the flour on a bowl, and the grease in ambient temperature in the middle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mix flour and grease with your fingertips, while slowly adding the salt water, until you end up with a dough ball.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knead it energically, until the dough forms bubbles on its surface.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let it rest for 1 or 2 hours, and then form little balls, the size you&amp;rsquo;d do for a chocolate chip cookie, smash them to a disc shape, then poke a small hole in the middle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fry it on abundant grease until golden brown, remove it with a perforated spoon, then put it on a bowl with paper towels to absorb excess grease.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add garnishes, but it is not essential, due to how rich and filling the dish is.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>🍽️ Servings: 2-4&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>NOTE: Prep time does not account for the 3-4 hours the dough must be left to rise and cool (see directions 5, 10, &amp;amp; 12).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>600ml ( 1 Pint ) warm water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon dry active baking yeast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>7 tablespoons honey&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1.5kg flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon salt&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Fill a large bowl with the water, and sprinkle with the yeast.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whisk together: honey, oil, 2 eggs, and salt. Add to bowl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add flour to bowl in small amounts, beating/whisking after each addition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the mixtures becomes a viscous dough, begin kneading until smooth and elastic, and no longer sticky.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let rise for 1-2 hours, or until dough has doubled in size.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sprinkle flour onto a chopping board, place the dough onto it and divide in half.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knead each half, adding flour as needed to keep the dough non-sticky.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Divide each half into thirds and roll into a long snake about 4cm (1.5in) in girth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pinch the ends of the each three snakes together firmly and plait them together, making two items of braided dough.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Grease two baking trays or use baking paper, cover with dry cloth and let rise for one hour. Preheat oven to 190°C / Gas mark 5.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whisk an egg and brush onto each plait, sprinkle with seeds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bake until bread has a hollow sound when tapped, cool on a rack for an hour before slicing.&lt;/li>

The starter can be done with either wheat flour or rye flour for rye breads. Prefer organic flours as they contain most wild yeasts.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>⏲️ Prep time: 5 min/day&lt;/li>
&lt;li>⏲️ Wait time: 4 days&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wheat or rye flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Water&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Day 1: mix 80g of water to 50g of flour and put a cover on the container loosely. Store somewhere warm.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Day 2: the starter should be a bit bubbly. Feed the starter with 80g of water and 50g of flour and store again with loosely covered. If the starter doesn&amp;rsquo;t have bubbles yet, wait another day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Day 3-4: repeat the feeding process&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can now use the starter for baking sourdough bread. Remember to not use all the starter at once and feed the remaining starter to always have it available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Storing the starter: store the starter in a closed container or jar in the fridge. The starter will survive almost indefinitely. After some time a vinegarish liquid forms on top of the starter. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of this, it is there to protect the starter from microbes. It can be poured away when you use the starter next time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When using the starter after long storage you need to activate it again. Feed it 1-2 times and see if bubbles form. You can also test the activity by placing small part into a glass of water. An active starter will float.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>⌛ Fermentation time: ~1 week&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>100 g of raisins&lt;/li>
&lt;li>100 g of sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 slices of black bread (e.g. pumpernickel bread, rye bread)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1-2 lemons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 pkg (7 g) of active dry yeast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Optional:&lt;/em>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>A handful of coffee beans&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Non-citrus fruits (e.g. plums, apples, kiwi)&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Bring 1 L of water in a pot to a boil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Burn black bread in a toaster or in an oven until it is thoroughly scorched to blackness on the outside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the water has come to boil, remove off heat. Add burned black bread, a handful of raisins, a few slices of lemon, and coffee beans to the pot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave contents of the pot to cool down to room temperature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Filter out everything from the pot through a strainer, and pour contents into a separate, sterilized container. Add sugar and yeast into
the container, and stir until sugar is dissolved. This starts the fermentation process. The amount of sugar in this recipe should yield 1.0%-2.5% alcohol
by total volume at the end of the fermentation process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add rest of raisins, and non-citrus fruits of your choice. The fruits will positively impact flavour of the final product.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If mixture is not already in a mason jar, pour the mixture into a sterile mason jar, and seal the lid. Place the jar in a warm place (26-30°C; 79-86°F),
and let it ferment for a week, or until it stops bubbling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove all raisins and fruits from the jar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Squeeze lemon juice from lemons into the mixture. You may drink the now-complete kvass right away, or refrigerate it before drinking.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve never made your own sourdough bread, it can be intimidating! But I believe it is absolutely worth the time and effort. You can look up videos to explain some of the methods listed, such as the stretch and fold, or different ways to shape your loaf. Fermenting grains has been a tradition of home cooking for millennia, and an art only lost in recent years. Fermenting grains has numerous health benefits, is much easier to digest, and even contains natural preservatives. You can get a sourdough starter from any bakery in your area, or make your own from scratch! Also, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a scale, get one!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>100g fed &lt;a href="https://based.cooking/sourdough-starter">sourdough starter&lt;/a> (levain)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>330g warm water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>137g bread flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>250g all-purpose flour (avoid bleached and enriched)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>87g rye or whole wheat flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>7g sea salt&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Combine sourdough starter with warm water, break apart and dissolve.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add flour and mix together gently to hydrate. Mixture will be very wet and sticky.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once there is no dry flour, let stand for 30 minutes (autolyze).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add sea salt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wet hands and begin to stretch and fold dough to combine salt and to begin gluten formation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add drops of water until dough becomes cohesive and supple with no toughness or resistance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dough will prove on the counter top for 4 - 5 hours. About every 30 minutes, perform a stretch and fold. This involves grabbing the dough with a wet hand, folding over the top of itself, and repeating this step by turning the bowl and making your way around the dough. It will take some practice to work with a dough of this level of hydration, but will get easier!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will know fermentation is complete when small bubbles are seen on the surface around the edge of your dough. You can also perform a window pane test by grasping a pinch of dough and pulling it between your fingers. The dough should stretch enough to become see-through. This means enough gluten has formed that the dough is strong enough to hold large air bubbles as it bakes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Turn onto generously floured surface using a bowl scraper or spatula to protect the dough. Handling the dough gently will prevent deflation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shape the dough: Take the two sides and fold them into the center of the wet dough. Then, take the top and bottom and fold them also over the center of the wet dough. Optional: grasp the edge of the dough closest to you and roll dough away from you into a tight loaf shape. Generously flour.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place into a dish about the size of the dough, a proving basket is ideal. Use a lot of flour in the bowl and on the loaf. The sides of the container should not be shallow, the goal here is to let the bread rest in the shape you want it to bake in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Refrigerate 12 - 24 hours, the longer the dough rests, the more sour your final product. I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend going over 24 hours but sour dough is fun to experiment with!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bring dough to room temperature, it should feel like a water balloon, giving resistance to touch with some spring.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put one oven rack in the center and another below it, place a pan of water on the lower rack. Preheat oven to 475 - 500 degrees F, depending on oven capability. The pan of water should create steam to help the bread expand.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When oven is hot, turn bread into a baking vessel. I use a 8 inch springform pan, but a dutch oven is ideal. You can use any vessel that is rated for high temperatures. If using a dutch oven, keep it covered for the first 15 minutes, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to use the pan of water.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Flour the top of the loaf and score the bread with a razor blade (this is optional but creates an artisan look)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bake covered/steamed for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 425 F. If using steam, remove the water pan now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bake for another 25 - 30 minutes until crust is a rusty color and sounds hollow when tapped.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let bread cool completely before slicing. (if you can wait!)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>A curry serves best with naan that is unleavened bread. Traditionally made in ‘Tandoor or clay oven&amp;rsquo; but at home, we will be making it in the oven and/or on the stovetop. Naan is not eaten solely but acts as assortments with meat, veggies, or egg items.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Put the yeast and sugar to warm milk in a large mixing bowl and stir well. Leave it for 3-5 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Sprinkle additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the sides.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once the dough is soft and ready, apply oil on it and cover it with a soft cloth. Rest it for 2–3 hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knead the dough again, sprinkle all-purpose flour, and knead until smooth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Form pieces into balls. Roll out dough balls to desired thickness (about the size of a small tortilla).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now transfer the naan to the foiled baking tray and bake in preheated at 180 C for 30-35 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After baking, brush the top with butter and cut it into four pieces and serve. Enjoy!&lt;/li>

&lt;li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 teaspoon paprika&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 teaspoons olive oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 lemons, thinly sliced and seeded&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place chicken, breast side down, on a work surface. Starting at the tail end, cut along both sides of backbone with kitchen shears. Remove backbone. Grabbing hold of both sides of the chicken, open it like a book. Turn breast side up. Push down on each side of breast with your hands until you hear it crack. Flatten chicken and transfer to one short end of the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the second chicken.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Combine salt, tarragon, paprika, and pepper in a small bowl. Stir in oil. Run your fingers under chicken skin and rub tarragon paste under skin. Slide lemon slices under skin, in a single layer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Roast until skin is crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast reads 165 degrees F, about 35 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting each chicken into 8 pieces.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This is a recipe for a basic loaf of bread. The dough itself can be used however. I&amp;rsquo;ve made buns, rolls, and whole bread loafs using this same exact dough every time without a problem. Eat within 3 days as it will probably be going stale around then (as bread without preservatives and other junk should).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 1/2 cups warm water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons Active Dry Yeast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 Tsp sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 Tbsp maple syrup, agave, or honey&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 Tbsp salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 3/4 cups Unbleached All-Purpose Flour (plus more for rolling / dusting)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Proof the yeast. To do this warm 1/4 cup water to about bath water heat (110 degrees F, 43 degrees C) add active dry yeast and 1 Tsp sugar. Let sit for about 10 minutes, mixture should at least be doubled in size after waiting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Combine rest of water, yeast mixture, maple syrup (or other sweetener), salt, and flour in a large mixing bowl and stir. The result will be a sticky, rough dough. Use a spoon to stir until well combined and when it can no longer do the job, knead and turn it in the bowl with your hands.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lift the dough out and lightly grease the bowl with nonstick spray or olive oil. Cover and let rise for 2 hours at room temperature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until dough is elastic. Rule of thumb is 10 minutes of kneading.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place seam-side down in a lightly greased loaf pan or baking sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 45-60 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C)* toward the end of the dough resting time and place a metal pan (NOT glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack. Also have 1 cup of hot water ready.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the oven is preheated, slash the bread 2 or 3 times with a knife, making a cut about ½-inch deep.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place in oven on middle rack. Then carefully pour hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. Expect it to bubble and steam; then close oven door quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bake the bread for 26 to 35 minutes, or until deep golden brown and risen. Tapping the top of the loaf should produce a hollow sound.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove the bread from the oven and let rest in the pan for 5 minutes. Then carefully remove from pan and transfer to a cooling rack to cool. Let it cool completely before slicing for best results (otherwise it can be doughy in the middle).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Store leftovers in a plastic bag at room temperature for up to a few days. Transfer to freezer for longer term storage.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="notes">Notes&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Instant yeast is not recommended as you can&amp;rsquo;t easily tell if the bread will come to life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For whole wheat version use 2 cups of whole wheat bread and 1 and 3/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add sunflower seeds and/or rolled oats for extra flavor/grains.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For buns or rolls divide dough into smaller pieces before second rest. Shape them and then let the dough rest. Recommended lowering oven temperature to 350 F and not using water as those will result in a hard crust and potentially dry interior.&lt;/li>
